    "Traditional methods (B-criterion and TS-criterion) rely on magnetic ﬁeld variations with a certain time lag. B-criterion has, as its main condition. In their methods, the IDs below the thresholds are artiﬁcially abandoned. Therefore, identiﬁcation criteria may affect the statistical results, and there is likely to be a discrepancy between the ﬁndings via B-criterion and TS-criterion."
