## Background

'Discontinuities' are discontinuous spatial changes in plasma parameters/characteristics and magnetic fields [@colburn1966].

They are observed across the heliosphere from inner heliosphere [@liu2022] to the heliosheath [@burlaga2011].

Discontinuities examples across the heliosphere
:::

@söding2001 studied the radial distribution of discontinuities in the solar wind between 0.3 and 19 AU during solar activity minimum. @liu2021 studied the spatial evolution of the discontinuities from 0.13-0.9 AU, using measurements from the Parker Solar Probe. [Typical rate of occurrence is about 50 per day at 1AU]{.aside}

### Importance

-   Contribution of Strong Discontinuities to the Power Spectrum

    > The strong discontinuities produce a power-law spectrum in the 'inertial subrange' with a spectral index near the Kolmogorov -5/3 index. The discontinuity spectrum contains about half of the power of the full solar-wind magnetic ﬁeld over this 'inertial subrange'. [@borovsky2010]

### Motivations

Studying the radial distribution of occurrence rate, as well as the properties of solar wind discontinuities may help answer the following questions:

-   How does the discontinuities change with the radial distance from the Sun?
-   How is solar wind discontinuities formed? What is the physical mechanisms?
    -   Generated at or near the sun?
    -   Locally generated in the interplanetary space by turbulence?

Joint observations of JUNO & ARTEMIS & Other missions really provides a unique opportunity!!!

Juno Spacecraft Cruise Trajectory
:::

-   Five-year cruise to Jupiter from 2011 to 2016
-   One earth flyby in 2013
-   Nearly the same Heliographic latitude as Earth

To eliminate the effect of the solar wind structure, we use data from other missions (mainly at 1AU) to provide a way of normalization.

## Methods

- We use [@liu2022a] method to identify IDs, which has better compatibility for the IDs with minor field changes.
- Then the minimum variance analysis is applied to each ID event to obtain the boundary normal (LMN) coordinate and extract IDs' features.

### ID identification (limited feature extraction / anomaly detection)

Traditional methods for ID identiﬁcation, such as the criteria of

-   Burlaga & Ness (1969; B-criterion) : a directional change of the magnetic ﬁeld larger than 30° during 60 s
-   Tsurutani & Smith (1979; TS-criterion) : $|ΔB|/|B| \geq 0.5$ within 3 minutes

Mostly rely on magnetic ﬁeld variations with a certain time lag. B-criterion has, as its main condition.

In their methods, the IDs below the thresholds are artiﬁcially abandoned. Therefore, identiﬁcation criteria may affect the statistical results, and there is likely to be a discrepancy between the ﬁndings via B-criterion and TS- criterion.

Liu's method : The first two conditions guarantee that the field changes of the IDs identiﬁed are large enough to be distinguished from the stochastic fluctuations on magnetic fields, while the third is a supplementary condition to reduce the uncertainty of recognition.

$$ \textrm{Index}_1 = \frac{\sigma(\vec{B})}{Max(\sigma(\vec{B}_-),\sigma(\vec{B}_+))} $$

$$ \textrm{Index}_2 = \frac{\sigma(\vec{B}_- + \vec{B}_+)} {\sigma(\vec{B}_-) + \sigma(\vec{B}_+)} $$

$$ \textrm{Index}_3 = \frac{| \Delta \vec{B} |}{|B_{bg}|} $$

$$ \textrm{Index}_1 \ge 2, \textrm{Index}_2 \ge 1, \textrm{Index}_3 \ge 0.1 $$

### Solar Wind Model {#solar-wind-model}

Sadly, JUNO does not provide plasma data during the cruise phase, so to estimate the plasma state we will use MHD model.

We are using [Michigan Solar WInd Model 2D (MSWIM2D)](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/MSWIM2D/), which models the solar wind propagation in 2D using the BATSRUS MHD solver. [@keebler2022]

Some key points about the model

-   Representing the solar wind in the ecliptic plane from 1 to 75 AU
-   2D MHD model, using the BATSRUS MHD solver
-   Inclusion of neutral hydrogen (important for the outer heliosphere)
-   Inner boundary is filled by time-shifting in situ data from multiple spacecraft

For model validation part, please see [JUNO Model Report](../analysis/20_model.ipynb).

## Conclusion

-   We have collected 5 years of solar wind discontinuities from JUNO, ARTEMIS and STEREO.
-   We have developed a pipeline to identify solar wind discontinuities. (Modular, Performant, Scalable)
-   The normalized occurrence rate of IDs drops with the radial distance from the Sun, following $1/r$ law.
-   The thickness of IDs increases with the radial distance from the Sun, but after normalization to ion inertial length, the thickness of IDs decreases.
-   The current intensity of IDs decrease with the radial distance from the Sun, but after normalization to the Alfven current , the current intensity of IDs increases.
