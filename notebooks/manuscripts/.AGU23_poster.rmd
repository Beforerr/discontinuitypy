main_findings:
- Solar wind discontinuities evolve in space with occurrence rate
  decreasing, **thickness increasing** and **current density
  decreasing** with distance from the Sun. And they are probably
  **generated locally** beyond 1 AU.
- "Background sheared magnetic field plays an important role in
  determining the efficiency of ion pitch angle scattering, and
  characterize three ion populations: **transient, trapped, regular**."

## Introduction & Motivation

'Discontinuities' are discontinuous spatial changes in plasma
parameters/characteristics and magnetic fields [@colburn1966].

@söding2001 studied the radial distribution of discontinuities in the
solar wind.

Joint observations of JUNO & ARTEMIS & Other missions really provides a
unique opportunity!!!

## Method

-   We use [@liu2022a] method to identify IDs, which has better
    compatibility for the IDs with minor field changes.
-   Then the minimum variance analysis is applied to each ID event to
    obtain the boundary normal (LMN) coordinate and extract IDs'
    features.
-   Hamiltonian model is applied for investigation of ion dynamics in
    the solar wind discontinuity configuration.
