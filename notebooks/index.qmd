# User Guide

This package is designed to identify and analyze discontinuities in time series data.

1. Finding the discontinuities, see [this notebook](./01_ids_detection.ipynb)
    - Corresponding to limited feature extraction / anomaly detection
2. Calculating the properties of the discontinuities, see [this notebook](./02_ids_properties.ipynb)
    - One can use higher time resolution data

For how to use this project as a python library, please see [this page](./00_ids_finder.ipynb).

See accompanying package [Discontinuity.jl](https://beforerr.github.io/Discontinuity.jl) for Julia about data processing and visualization.

## Installation

```shell
pip install discontinuitypy
```

# Properties of Discontinuities

Notations:

- $\vec{B}$ : Magnetic field in *ANY* coordinate system
- $B$ : Magnetic field magnitude

For the unit, by default we use

-   length : $km$
-   time : $s$
-   magnetic field : $nT$
-   current : $nA/m^2$

## Outputs

- `t_{us,ds}` :  moments of time corresponding to upstream and downstream boundaries of the current sheet
- `b_mag` : mean of magnetic field magnitude across the discontinuity
- `db_over_b` : $|\Delta B|/\bar{B}$ , Change in magnetic field magnitude over magnetic field magnitude (mean)
    - see Fig.14 in @tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979
- `rotation_angle` : Rotation angle across the discontinuity
    - see Fig.12 in @tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979
    - see Fig.11 in @sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001
- `bn_over_b` : $\bar{B}_N/\bar{B}$ : Normal component of magnetic field over magnetic field magnitude (mean)


- $\vec{e}_l, \vec{e}_m, \vec{e}_n$ : unit vector in the direction of the maxium, medium, minium variance magnetic field in *ANY* coordinate system `e_{max/med/min}{x,y,z}`
- $\vec{n}$ : normal of the discontinuity plane
- $\vec{n}_{\text{MVA}}$ : normal from minimum variance analysis (unit vector in the minium variance direction) `n_mva = e_min`
- $\vec{n}_{\text{cross}}$ : cross product of the magnetic field vector $B_u$ upstream and the field vector $B_d$ downstream of the transition `n_cross`


-   `v_{x,y,z}`: plasma speed in the *ANY* coordinate system, in units of $km/s$

-   `plasma_speed`: plasma speed, in units of $km/s$

-   `plasma_density`: plasma density, in units of $1/cm^{3}$

-   `plasma_temperature`: plasma temperature, in units of $K$

-   `L_mn{_norm}`: thickness of the current sheet in MN direction, in units of $km$

-   `j0{_norm}`: current density, in units of $nA/m^2$
