# User Guide

This package is designed to identify and analyze discontinuities in time series data.

1. Finding the discontinuities, see [this notebook](./01_ids_detection.ipynb)
    - Corresponding to limited feature extraction / anomaly detection
2. Calculating the properties of the discontinuities, see [this notebook](./02_ids_properties.ipynb)
    - One can use higher time resolution data

For how to use this project as a python library, please see [this page](./00_ids_finder.ipynb).

## Installation

```shell
pip install discontinuitypy
```

## Getting started

Import the package

```python
from discontinuitypy.utils.basic import *
from discontinuitypy.core import *
```

# Properties of Discontinuities

Notations:

- $\vec{B}$ : Magnetic field
- $B$ : Magnetic field magnitude

## Outputs

- `b_mag` : mean of magnetic field magnitude across the discontinuity
- `db_over_b` : $|\Delta B|/\bar{B}$
    - see Fig.14 in @tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979
- `rotation_angle` : Rotation angle across the discontinuity
    - see Fig.12 in @tsurutaniInterplanetaryDiscontinuitiesTemporal1979
    - see Fig.11 in @sodingRadialLatitudinalDependencies2001
